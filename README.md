## Code Explanation

The provided code is organized into several sections:

### 1. Initialization and Setup

The code starts by including necessary libraries and defining constants for device names, pin numbers, and other parameters. It initializes the DHT sensor and sets up the GPIO pins.

```cpp
#include "RMaker.h"
#include "WiFi.h"
#include "WiFiProv.h"
#include <DHT.h>
#include <SimpleTimer.h>

const char *service_name = "CY_SmartHome";
const char *pop = "12345678";

// Define the Chip Id
uint32_t espChipId = 5;

// Define the Node Name
char nodeName[] = "CY_Smarthome";

// Define the Device Names
char deviceName_1[] = "Light";
char deviceName_2[] = "Night Light";
char deviceName_3[] = "Fan";
char deviceName_4[] = "Power Socket";

// Define the GPIO connected with Relays and switches
static uint8_t RelayPin1 = 23;
static uint8_t RelayPin2 = 22;
static uint8_t RelayPin3 = 21;
static uint8_t RelayPin4 = 19;

static uint8_t SwitchPin1 = 13;
static uint8_t SwitchPin2 = 12;
static uint8_t SwitchPin3 = 14;
static uint8_t SwitchPin4 = 27;

static uint8_t wifiLed = 2;
static uint8_t gpio_reset = 0;
static uint8_t DHTPIN = 18;
static uint8_t LDR_PIN = 39;

float temperature1 = 0;
float humidity1 = 0;
float ldrVal = 0;

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHT11);
SimpleTimer Timer;
```

### 2. Provisioning and Callbacks
The sysProvEvent and write_callback functions handle provisioning events and actions for the smart devices.

```cpp
void sysProvEvent(arduino_event_t *sys_event) {
  // Handle provisioning events
}

void write_callback(Device *device, Param *param, const param_val_t val, void *priv_data, write_ctx_t *ctx) {
  // Handle device actions
}
```
### 3. Reading Sensors
The readSensor and sendSensor functions read data from the DHT sensor and LDR, and send the data to ESP Rain Maker.

```cpp
void readSensor() {
  // Read data from sensors
}

void sendSensor() {
  readSensor();
  temperature.updateAndReportParam("Temperature", temperature1);
  humidity.updateAndReportParam("Temperature", humidity1);
  ldr.updateAndReportParam("Temperature", ldrVal);
}
```
### 4. Manual Control
The manual_control function handles manual switching of devices using physical buttons.

```cpp
void manual_control() {
  // Check switch states and control relays
}
```
### 5. Setup and Loop
The setup function initializes the ESP32, sets up devices, and starts provisioning. The loop function handles periodic sensor reading and manual control.

```cpp

void setup() {
  // Initialization and setup code
}

void loop() {
  // Main loop code
}
```


## C++ and OOP Concept Approach in Project Source Code

In the provided source code for the Smart Home Automation project using ESP32 Rain Maker, C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts are effectively utilized to structure and manage the functionality of the system. Hereâ€™s how C++ and OOP principles are applied:

### Object-Oriented Approach

#### Classes and Objects
- **Switch Class**: Defined for managing relay-based switches (e.g., `my_switch1`, `my_switch2`, etc.). Each switch is instantiated as an object (`Switch`) with methods to control its state (`toggleState`) and update parameters (`updateAndReportParam`).
- **TemperatureSensor, HumiditySensor, LDR Classes**: These classes encapsulate sensor functionalities (temperature, humidity, LDR). They provide methods to read sensor values (`readSensor`), update parameters (`updateAndReportParam`), and handle sensor-specific operations.

#### Encapsulation
- Member variables (`toggleState_1`, `toggleState_2`, etc.) and member functions (`write_callback`, `readSensor`, `sendSensor`, `manual_control`) are encapsulated within their respective classes. For instance:
  - The **Switch** class encapsulates relay control logic and callback handling (`write_callback`).
  - **Sensor** classes encapsulate sensor reading logic (`readSensor`) and parameter reporting (`updateAndReportParam`).

#### Abstraction
- Abstracting device functionalities into classes (**Switch**, **TemperatureSensor**, etc.) allows treating each device type uniformly while hiding implementation details. This promotes code reuse, enhances modularity, and simplifies maintenance.

### C++ Concepts Utilized in the Code

    - **Sensor Values**: Variables to store temperature, humidity, and LDR values.

3. **Object Instantiation**

    - **SimpleTimer**: `SimpleTimer Timer;` creates a timer instance.
    - **Device Instances**: Objects for switches and sensors using the RainMaker framework.

4. **Functions**
    - `sysProvEvent()`: Handles system provisioning events and updates Wi-Fi LED status.
    - `write_callback()`: Callback function for handling device parameter updates.
    - `readSensor()`: Reads data from the DHT sensor and LDR.
    - `sendSensor()`: Sends sensor data to the cloud.
    - `manual_control()`: Handles manual control of devices via switches.

5. **Setup and Loop Functions**
    - `setup()`: Initializes serial communication, sets up GPIOs, initializes the DHT sensor, sets up RainMaker nodes and devices, and starts Wi-Fi provisioning.
    - `loop()`: Monitors the reset button, manages Wi-Fi connectivity, sends sensor data at intervals, and handles manual control.

6. **Detailed C++ Concepts**
    - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
        - **Class Instantiation**: Instances of DHT, SimpleTimer, and RainMaker devices.
        - **Method Calls**: Using object methods like `dht.readHumidity()`, `Timer.setInterval()`, and `RMaker.initNode()`.
        - **Callback Functions**: Implementing callbacks such as `write_callback()` for handling device events.
    - **Control Structures**
        - **Conditionals**: `if` statements to handle different conditions in `write_callback()`, `manual_control()`, and `loop()`.
        - **Loops**: `for` loop in `setup()` for generating the chip ID; `while` loop in `loop()` for button debounce.
    - **Data Types and Operators**
        - **Data Types**: Usage of `const char*`, `uint8_t`, `bool`, `float`, `int`.
        - **Operators**: Arithmetic (`+`, `-`), logical (`&&`, `||`), comparison (`==`, `!=`), assignment (`=`, `+=`), and ternary (`?:`) operators.

### Setup and Usage

Hardware Setup: Connect all components as per the circuit diagram.
Software Setup: Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE.
Provisioning: Use the ESP Rain Maker app to provision the device and set up WiFi credentials.

### Control Appliances with Google Assistant and Alexa

You can control the appliances using voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa. For example:
- "Hey Google, turn on switch-1" will turn on the light connected to switch-1.
- "Hey Google, turn off switch-1 and switch-3" will turn off the lights connected to switch-1 and switch-3.
- "Hey Google, turn on switch 2 and switch 4" will turn on the lights connected to switch-2 and switch-4.
- "Hey Google, turn on all switches" will turn on all connected lights.

If you have any Alexa or Google Assistant-supported devices, you can control appliances from them directly. For example, using a smartwatch with built-in Alexa support, you can say "Turn On switch 1" to control the appliances.

### Control Appliances with Manual Switches

You can control the lights using manual switches even without an internet connection. When Wi-Fi is turned off, the blue LED will turn off, indicating that only manual control is available. When Wi-Fi is restored, the ESP32 will automatically reconnect, and the blue LED will turn on, allowing control via Alexa and Google Assistant again.

### Monitoring and Automation with ESP RainMaker

Using the ESP RainMaker app, you can control switches and monitor sensor readings for temperature, humidity, and light levels. For instance:
- Covering the LDR sensor will decrease its value.
- Increasing the temperature with external heat will show the corresponding increase in sensor readings.

You can also add automation to control the relays based on a predefined schedule. For example, you can create a schedule to turn on the 2nd and 4th relays at a specific time. This feature allows for highly customizable automation according to your requirements.
